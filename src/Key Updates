1) Change from returning a tuple of the sorted array and time to just returning the time
Since arrays are passed by reference, there is no need to return the sorted array. 
My primary motivation for doing so earlier was so that when I run tests, the sample array
I want to test on is not modified each time:

b = [1,34,23,86,2]
arr,t = insertionSortWithTime(b) # Now b looks like [1,2,23,34,86]
arr2,t2 = binaryInsertionSortWithTime(b) # So a sorted array is passed into the second test!

But now I realize that is not the correct way to achieve what I want to do. Instead,
I can define a copy() function which makes a copy of the test array to be passed into
the tests I write (like the two above).

And then, when I am done testing and actually apply my algorithm to a real dataset, then
I want the dataset to be sorted, so I can directly do it rather than sorting copies.

In both cases, there is no need for a tuple to return the sorted array
